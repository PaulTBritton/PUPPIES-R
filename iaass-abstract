Summary of the paper
        PUPPIES (Programmable Uncertain Parameter Propagation Into
        Equations Software) is an open source, R language based, suite
        of scripts for building Monte Carlo Simulations and plotting
	uncertainty results. It is the brainchild of the vision that,
	in the year 2014, PRA analysts across the globe ought to have a
	common open source Monte Carlo Simulation tool that is feature-rich,
	scalable and easily programmable with the capability of being
	extensively automated.  To achieve this vision we adopt a philosophy
	analogous to the Unix philosophy. The emphasis is on building short,
	simple, clear code objects that can be easily repurposed by the end
	user. Herein, will describe the current state of PUPPIES in terms of
	its capabilities, strengths, limitations, forward work, and
	advantages over other tools.

Proposed type of presentation (oral or poster)
        oral

The abstract shall clearly outline the major interests and novelties of the paper.
